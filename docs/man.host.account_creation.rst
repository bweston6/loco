Creating an Account & Logging In
================================
The process for gaining access to your account is the same whether you have an existing account or not. If you already had an account, all of you existing information will sill be there. Just type in the same email you used before to get going again.

#. Select whether you are a :term:`host<Host>` or an :term:`attendee<Attendee>`.

   .. note:: If you both host and attend lectures that record attendance, you will need to create two accounts with separate emails
#. Enter your email address and tap ``verify email``. This will send a 6 digit one-time passcode to this email address. The one-time passcode is valid for 1 hour after the email is sent or until it is used, whichever comes first.

   .. note:: If you suspect you have mistyped your email after tapping "verify email", you can tap "re-enter email" to go back and try again.
   
   .. warning:: If you are an attendee you should use your university email in the form: ``sgjapple@university.ac.uk``. This will allow you to access to pre-existing events.
#. On the next screen enter the one time passcode your received and your full name. If you are logging into an existing account, this will allow you to change your full name.
